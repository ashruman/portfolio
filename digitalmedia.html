        Interactive Digital Multimedia is a course I took on creating interactive art, primarily through programming with JavaScript.
        I created multiple pieces for critique, almost all of which can be played/experienced in browser. 
    </p>

    <h2>Log On/Log Off</h2>
    <p>
        <a href="https://editor.p5js.org/ashr/full/FSixrOKY4">"Log On/Log Off"</a> is an unwinnable game about trying to clean my room, as well as the first piece I created with p5.js.
        I programmed multiple scripts and interactive elements, which I then put together to create a simulation of opening windows on a computer.
    </p>

    <h2>try anyway?</h2>
    <p>
        <a href="https://editor.p5js.org/ashr/full/U6r5c-DSP">"try anyway?"</a> is a piece about self-expression, created for the prompt "abstract something that cannot be abstracted". 
        This piece requires microphone and camera access. 
        I wanted to prompt the users/audience to express themselves as many ways as possible, giving them the ability to use text, audio, art, video, and eventually the code itself.
    </p>

    <h2>Real Fruit Ninja</h2>
    <p>
        The full version of this piece used both p5.js and an Arduino board with a capacitive touch sensor. 
        I created a game similar to "Fruit Ninja", using actual fruit as the controls.

        (TO DO: image and code links)
        Sadly this piece can't be played online without reconstructing the physical hardware (and fruit), but
        you can play a version using keyboard controls below.
