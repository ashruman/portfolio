    <p>Hi, I'm Asher! Thanks for checking out my website.</p>
    <p>
        I'm a software engineer with experience in a variety of different languages and software. 
        I'm passionate about technology, and am always eager to learn more or teach others. 
        Currently, I'm pursuing a Computer Science degree from Smith College ('24), continuing development on the game <em>Aliens Want Out Mascot?!</em>, and searching for a fulltime software developer role starting in 2024.
    </p>
    <p>
        While my skillset is more generalized, and I'm always ready to adapt to any new programming challenge, my personal area of interest lies in games and interactive media.
        From organizing a club trip to PAX East, to producing a mobile game with MassDigi, to giving a research talk on MMORPG players, I'm constantly finding ways to explore my passion for games.
