        <em>Aliens Want Our Mascot?!</em> is a tower defense game 
        about a high school that bands together to protect their school mascot from alien invaders.
        As part of MassDigi's 2023 Summer Innovation Program, my team and I developed this game from concept to launch in 11 weeks. 
        Working with such a small team and short timeframe allowed me to gain experience programming a variety of game systems, as well as
        experience the entire game development process of prototyping, playtesting, and iterating to meet tight deadlines.
