    <p>
        After taking an Intro to Programming course during my first year of college, I wanted to try building a game with my new Python programming skills.
        I created this project on my own in one week, using the <a href="https://www.pygame.org/wiki/about">Pygame</a> library to create a system that would let me easily create text-based games with simple visuals.
    </p>
    <p>
        Pygame provides a lot of functionality for creating visuals, sound, and some basic game systems, but I still had to create, customize, or write code for almost every facet of the game.
        Features include:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Selecting a player character.</li>
        <li>Menus for selecting dialogue, items, or other options.</li>
        <li>Branching routes depending on dialogue choices.</li>
        <li>Animated (scrolling) text.</li>
        <li>Character icons.</li>
        <li>Scene changes, background music changes, and sound effects can be linked to dialogue and player choices.</li>
        <li>Inventory system.</li>
        <li>Title screen.</li>
        <li>Save files and autosave.</li>
        <li>Resizable game window.</li>
        <li>Characters, dialogue, visuals, and audio can be easily changed, allowing for the creation of multiple games/stories using this project as a framework.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        You can view the project on GitHub <a href="https://github.com/ashruman/VN-Game-Engine">here</a>.
